Wesley Dzitzer static HTML/CSS/JavaScript Portfolio Website

-**NOTE** As of November 3rd, 2020, this static website repo is dis-continued from support. This repo and website's GitHub pages deployment will remain as it contains examples of other miscellaneous JavaScript static web embedded examples such as a textbox and calculator. To see my full ReactJS portfolio website that I currently support, visit [this following repo](https://github.com/Wesley26/wd-react-portfolio).
